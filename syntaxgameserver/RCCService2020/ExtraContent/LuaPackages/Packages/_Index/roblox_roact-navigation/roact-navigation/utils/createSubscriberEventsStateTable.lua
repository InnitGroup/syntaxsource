--[[
	Provides a StateTable for sending events to user screens on screen state changes.

	Args:
		name					- Name for state table debugging.
		emit(type, payload)		- Function to emit a single raw event.
		disconnectAll()			- Function to disconnect all listeners.

	States:
		Blurred					- Screen is not visible, but was at least animated on/off before.
		Focusing				- Screen is moving to being visible.
		Focused					- Screen is visible.
		Blurring				- Screen is moving to being hidden.
		Disconnected			- Screen is no longer part of the hierarchy and will not propagate events to user.

	Accepted Event Types (always sent using Normal Events Pattern):
		NavigationEvents.WillFocus
		NavigationEvents.DidFocus
		NavigationEvents.WillBlur
		NavigationEvents.DidBlur
		NavigationEvents.Action
		NavigationEvents.Refocus	- Note that Refocus events do NOT support the pattern. Send them without adornment!

	Normal Events Pattern:
		[<Event> .. "A"]		- Received event while screen is active child and not currently transitioning.
		[<Event> .. "T"]		- Received event while screen is not active child, but is transitioning.
		[<Event> .. "AT"]		- Received event while screen is active child and currently transitioning.
		[<Event>]				- Received event while screen is not active child, and not currently transitioning.

	Special Events:
		shutdown				- Page has been removed from hierarchy, so shut down further event handling.
